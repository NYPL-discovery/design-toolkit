### Assistive Technology  
#### Screen Readers  
Screen readers are software which render web content through a voice synthesizer or braille display. These depend on well formatted html both for clear navigation of the content and because the software will render non-visual components of the html, ex. alt and longdesc tags containing descriptions of page images.

* For more information on the popularity of various AT and commonly used browsers, visit WebAIMâ€™s [Screen Reader User Survey](http://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey6/) from 2015.
* The majority of users of screen readers are PC.
* All NYPL pc's have MAGic (screen magnification) and JAWs (voiceover) installed on them. Each PC also has [orientation materials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nWjt7NakMjhuc8yWblkuxIZJ4RxPlJ0WV5JzSPmttB8/edit?ts=582a2490) for patrons and staff for how to get started with this software.
* Screen readers rely on a number of common keyboard commands, so keep that in mind if selecting shortcuts for your product.
* Likewise, be sure to check functionality of common shortcuts when building new pages.
* JAWS stands for Job Access With Speech. It is one of the most common screen readers and **all Library PCs have JAWS installed**.
