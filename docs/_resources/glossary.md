### Andrew Heiskell  
The [Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library](https://www.nypl.org/locations/heiskell) is a branch library which
provides talking books and magazines and braille for people who are blind, visually impaired, or are otherwise physically unable to read standard print. The library serves residents who live in New York City and Long Island and is regional library for the [NLS](https://www.loc.gov/nls/).

For more information on the history of the Andrew Heiskell branch and the services offered there, visit the [About Page](https://www.nypl.org/about/locations/heiskell).

### ARIA  
ARIA labels are used to create Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA). For example, if you have a search page where search results change dynamically, the aria-live and aria-relevant labels can alert the user of a screen reader that content on the page has changed. Visit the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) documentation for clear applications of these tags in widgets, landmark regions, and more.

### Bard  
Braille and Audio Download service for active Talking Book patrons registered with an NLS network library.

### Bookshare   

### PAWs   
The Andrew Heiskell collection is served through a separate discovery layer called [PAWs](https://webopac.klas.com/ny1aopac/).

### Section 508  

### WCAG 2.0  
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines were created by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of W3C. These standards are considered the commonly accepted compliance standards for web accessibility.

The standard is organized by 4 principles: Perceivable, Operable, Operable, Robust. Summaries of each principle, [found here](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/glance/) are a good place to start for understanding how the technical specifications of these accessibility guidelines map to the four principles. For a more in-depth mapping of specific guidelines and the four guiding principles, visit this [quick reference sheet](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/).

Within the technical specifications, the WCAG 2.0 standard has three levels: A, AA, AAA. By design, not all content can be made compliant with AAA. **The library uses compliance with level AA and, where applicable, level AAA, as a measure of web accessibility. Compliance with WCAG 2.0 is not the definition of accessible; it is an base lining, assessment tool.**

### VPATs  
Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates (VPATS) document a product's conformance and interpretation of accessibility standards; in the case of NYPL, these standards are WCAG 2.0 AA and Section 508 standards. They can be used as a rubric for evaluating products during development, generating issues to resolve compliance conflicts, and documenting any subjective decisions made. For example, see [Standard 3.1.2 in the Maps by Decade VPAT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xHhy6qQfZhWq-KktV__cWSfCnPQtTe0fhapS_Ka2HWs/edit). Product teams are responsible for maintaining VPATs.
