## Development Checklist

The following is a non-exhaustive list of concrete elements which help *create a foundation* for accessible design. Intended to for use during active development in parallel with the wider design toolkit resources. While pulled in part from WCAG 2.0 AA, not all success criteria are represented and for those that are sometimes only a part of the criteria are represented.  

### Checklist for All Pages
These items are required of all products. If you believe you are facing one of the **very rare** cases where these cannot be applied, consult with the coordinator before proceeding.  

####  HTML is valid.
**Standard**: [4.1.1 | Parsing](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-parses.html)  
**Rule**: HTML/XHTML must be valid.   
**Test**: your favorite validator, ex [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/)  

####  Pages have `titles`
**Standard**: [2.4.2 | Page Titled](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-title.html)  
**Rule**: All pages have unique and meaningful html `title` elements.  
**Test**: automated & manual evaluation    

####  Pages have a `lang` element
**Standard**: [3.1.1 | Language of Page](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-doc-lang-id.html)  
**Rule**: HTML `lang` element for page is present in `head`.  
**Test**: automated    

####  Unique language sections have `lang` element
<!--this example could be more clear - maybe model like the rest of the toolkit code snippets-->
**Standard**: [3.1.2 | Language of Parts](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-other-lang-id.html)  
**Rule**: If a *section* of a page is in a different language than the language of the page, the section's language is noted in an `lang` element. For example, if a page is in English and a block quote is in Spanish, a `lang` element would note this: `<blockquote lang="es">Por ejemplo</blockquote>`  
Exceptions to this rule are proper names, technical terms, words which are part of vernacular, a lot of library metadata.  
**Test**: automated   

#### Names, roles, and values are programmatically available   
**Standard**: [4.1.2 | Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/minimize-error-reversible.html)  
**Rule**: Name, role, and value of components are programmatically available.    
**Test**:   

####  Minimum color contrast
**Standard**: [1.4.3 | Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html)  
**Rule**: Text and images of text have a ratio of at least 4.5:1. Large text (over 18 point or 14 point bold) has minimum ratio of 3:1.  
**Test**: automated   

####  Focus is visible
**Standard**: [2.4.7 | Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-visible.html)  
**Rule**: As you keyboard navigate through a page, the focus is visible. The default browser focus should never be suppressed unless reliably and fully replaced with higher quality focus.  
**Test**: manual evaluation

####  Images of text aren't used, except logos
**Standard**: [1.4.5 | Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-text-presentation.html)  
**Rule**: Do not use images of text unless they are logos.  
**Test**: manual  

####  Bypass blocks mechanism
**Standard**: [2.4.1 | Bypass Blocks](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-skip.html)  
**Rule**: Users should be able to easily skip content *repeated among pages*. Navigation should be through **either** clear, strong semantic headings structure **or** a skip to main content link. If skip to main content link is used, link should be always be visible or should be visible on focus.  
**Test**: manual assessment  

####  200% Text resize
**Standard**: [1.4.4 | Resize text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-scale.html)   
**Rule**: Within the browser, text should be able to be resized up to 200% and the product should retain content and functionality. Images of text and captions are exempted.    
**Test**: manual assessment  

####  Multisensory instructions
**Standard**: [1.3.3 | Sensory Characteristics](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-understanding.html)  
**Rule**: Instructions never depend on perception of a visual sense(s). For example, "Related pages are in right hand column" is inadequate. "Related pages are in the "Resources" section of the right hand column" is better.  
**Test**:   

####  Use of color
**Standard**: [1.4.1 | Use of Color](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html)  
**Rule**: Never rely soley on color to differentiate or identify components and page sections. For example, a form can't have 2 identical buttons differentiated only with one being green and one red with instructions to users "click the red button to submit"  
**Test**: manual assessment  

####  Content time limits are minimized to the maximum
**Standard**: [2.2.1 | Timing Adjustable](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-required-behaviors.html)

**Test**:   

####  Lists, special text, and other structures use semantic markup
**Standard**: [1.3.1 | Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html)  
**Rule**: Content structure and relationships need to be represented programmatically or with text to ensure that those structures persist if the content's presentation format changes. This means using appropriate semantic markup such as `<ol>` for ordered lists and `<abbr>` for abbreviations.  
**Test**: automated & manual evaluation  


####  Semantic headings
**Standards**: [1.3.1 | Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html) // [1.3.2 | Meaningful Sequence](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-sequence.html)   
**Rule**: Heading structure is represented with semantic markup. The structure begins wih `h1` and increases by *only one* level at a time. For example, `h2` cannot be followed by `h4`. Multiple levels can be skipped when moving from header with a higher level to a lower one. For example, the following sequence is acceptable: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`  
**Test**:   

####  Headings and Labels are descriptive and mostly unique
**Standard**: [2.4.6 | Headings and Labels](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-descriptive.html)  
**Rule**: Headings and labels must be descriptive and should be meaningful *out of context*. For example, avoid duplicating headings like "Read more" on pages.  
**Test**: manual evaluation

**Standard**: [2.4.5 | Multiple  Ways](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-mult-loc.html)  
**Rule**: Within a product, there are multiple pathways to the respective pages and sections. Multiple pathways are not needed if a page is a step in a processâ€”like a form submission confirmation page.  
**Test**:   

####  Fully keyboard navigable
**Standard**: [2.1.1 | Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-keyboard-operable.html)  
**Rule**: Keyboard interface can operate all product functionality. Timing requirements on keystrokes are restricted. Product shortcuts should not include standard browser and AT shortcuts.<!--reference resources on shortcuts to avoid in resources section; first research and add those-->  
**Test**: manual evaluation  

####  No keyboard traps
**Standard**: [2.1.2 | No Keyboard Trap](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-trapping.html)  
**Rule**: Users should be able to keyboard navigate a full page without getting trapped! User should always be able to remove focus from a component with arrow, tab, or other standard exits; If a non-standard is used, user is informed and instructed.    
**Test**: manual evaluation  

####  Meaningful sequence is agnostic to display format
<!---Is this one concrete enough for the purposes of this list?-->
**Standard**: [1.3.2 | Meaningful Sequence](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-sequence.html)

**Standard**: [3.2.3 | Consistent Navigation](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-consistent-locations.html)
